### Weather Logger

The goal of this project is to compare predicted vs true precipitation for a given longitude/latitude, recording the accumulation once per week (on tuesdays). 
This will be used to monitor weather patterns in a given area (for the sake of this script, a piece of land on galiano island), and how much they differ from predicted values. 

## The Future of this Project
Next steps include visualization the data, providing a visual interface, and including more weather patterns than only precipitation.
